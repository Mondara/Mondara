👋 Hey there, I'm Mondara!

🚀 A tinker by heart, I have a real passion for learning, building, and problem-solving. My earliest memory is building a massive 1+ meter spaceship out of cardboard and proudly carrying it to my school for show and tell.

💼 I am a self-taught developer with 3 years of experience, focusing on Frontend Development. However, I aspire to become a Full-stack developer having learned the MERN Stack through hands-on projects. In terms of technology, I have extensive experience with Javascript, Typescript, React, and Node.js. Besides web development, I also have experience in Manual and Automation Testing with Java/Selenium. 

📚In my spare time, I take online courses and read books, currently reading “Javascript A Definitive Guide” to gain a deeper understanding of Javascript and taking Next.js courses (because it looks cool). I also build websites currently focusing on Full-stack applications, building a link-sharing app for developers!
